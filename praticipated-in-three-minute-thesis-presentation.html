          Imagine, one day, you wake up and turn on your coffee machine, but it doesn't make your coffee because there is a power outage. That’s frustrating – we need our coffee! Outages occur due to faults, extreme events, storms, which we can see. But they can also occur due to oscillations that we cannot see or physically feel. We try to solve this.
          <p align = "justify">
          Oscillations are always present in the power system because of small random changes within the system such as load changes. Loads in a power system mean things like a coffee machine, light bulb, industrial equipment, or anything that needs electricity to run. These are called natural oscillations and the system oscillates at its natural frequencies.
          <p align = "justify">
          In addition to that, there can be another kind of oscillation that is not natural, called Forced Oscillation. Forced Oscillation is external to the system and can be caused by unexpected equipment failure, abnormal operating conditions, and devices malfunctions. It can occur at any frequency. And, if the forced oscillation frequency is close to the natural oscillation frequency already present in the system, it can create a resonance effect.
          <p align = "justify">
          A typical example to understand resonance is the collapsing of the Tacoma Bridge. It was caused due to resonance between the wind up-down frequency and the natural frequency of the bridge.
          <p align = "justify">
          Because of resonance, forced oscillation can spread to large distances in the system hundreds of miles away from the source which can cause potential disturbances like a power outage. This can also cause severe damage to critical and expensive equipment in the system like generators.
          <p align = "justify">
          The only way to avoid this is to locate the source of forced oscillation as soon as we can and mitigate or remove it entirely.
          <p align = "justify">
          In my thesis, I focus on developing an algorithm for an accurate location of forced oscillation of various kinds and characteristics. We already know that resonance during forced oscillation is bad for the system. Locating the source is equally difficult. The algorithm will work and locate the source during resonance as well. For this, during forced oscillation, we observe responses from different parts of the system, compare them, and locate the source.
          This will help to decide on mitigating measures during forced oscillation and avoid potential damages such as power outages or blackouts. Also, protect critical and expensive equipment in the system.
          <p align = "justify">
          I hope no one will be deprived of morning coffee if the reason is forced oscillation.
